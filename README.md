This enables you to manage user points seamlessly across different platforms.

2. Upload the `loyalty` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the Loyalty Plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Go to the Loyalty Plugin settings and configure API credentials.
5. **Done!** Your Loyalty Plugin is now installed and configured to synchronize points from the external API with your Points and Rewards Plugin.
